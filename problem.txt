SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key LIKE '%city'
GROUP BY tags.value
ORDER BY count DESC;


Returns as expected:

Frisco	495
Plano	27
Fort Worth	8
Dallas	7
Cedar Hill	4
McKinney	4
Waxahachie	4
Irving	3
Wylie	3
Grand Prairie	2
The Colony	2
100	1
2	1
Arlington	1
Corinth	1
Denton	1
Duncanville	1
Euless	1
Farmers Branch	1
Keller	1
Kennedale	1
Lewisville	1
Little Elm	1

So I try to isolate the non-alpha results (so as to clean them) with the following query:
SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as count
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key LIKE '%city'
AND tags.value GLOB '%[^0-9]%'
ORDER BY count DESC

But I get a NULL response.  Suspecting the GLOB was the problem, I tried to match on a specific string:
SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as count
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key LIKE '%city'
AND tags.value GLOB 'Frisco'
ORDER BY count DESC

This worked... so I tried to modify to get this result for Frisco using a wildcard:
SELECT tags.value, COUNT(*) as count
FROM (SELECT * FROM nodes_tags UNION ALL 
      SELECT * FROM ways_tags) tags
WHERE tags.key LIKE '%city'
AND tags.value GLOB 'Fris%'
ORDER BY count DESC

This did NOT work.  Can you help me figure out why the wildcard does not seem to be working in the GLOB?
