Hi, all... quick question.  I am working through Exploratory Data Analysis, Lesson 9, Quiz 8.  I attempted to write these plots using ggplot (as opposed to qplot as suggested) and R Studio just froze when I executed grid.arrange.  So, I tried using qplot... same result.  I viewed the answer and copied every line exactly as the solution says (I think)... same result.  Here are the two attempts:

plot1 <- ggplot(aes(x = price), data = diamonds) +
 geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
 ggtitle('Price')

plot2 <- ggplot(aes(x = log10(price)), data = diamonds) +
 geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
 scale_x_log10() +
 ggtitle('Price (log10)')


And with qplot:
plot1 <- qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 0.01) +
 ggtitle('Price')

plot2 = qplot(x = price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 0.01) +
 ggtitle('Prie (log10)') +
 scale_x_log10()

After each of these attempts to define the plots, this is the grid.arrange command I used:

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol = 2)

Thoughts on why R Studio hangs?

One more thing... I try to terminate execution and eventually my entire R session crashes and I have to restart R Studio.

Thanks! (edited)
